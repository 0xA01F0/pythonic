__A clean, well-documented guide to writing idiomatic Python.__ This project is a Python developer’s companion — a collection of files, each focusing on an important principle, pattern etc. in Pythonic coding. Each file is designed to be read and understood directly, without external references.



### --> Philosophy

Python isn’t just a language — it’s a mindset. From PEP8 to practical elegance, from readability to runtime clarity, this project explores what it means to “write Python like a Pythonista.”
                                            ^ -> also some extra things I felt like including, good for writing clean code



### --> File Guide

All files in the repo pretty much tell you what they are about ( <-- filename = what it's about --> ) EXCEPT for the last file, the last file just speaks about private functions ( e.g. def _hello)
                                                                                                                                                                                             ^ underscore = private func
^^ although private functions aren´t necessarily apart of a principle of writing pythonic code, I simply just felt like including it.

### --> Style & Pedagogy

This repo is NOT all code. I wanted to actually talk about what each thing does and what certain things can be used for, not just have code in it without any explanation whatsoever. 
             ^ it's heavily noted.



### --> For Learners and Veterans

Whether you’re new and learning the ropes, or experienced and refining your instincts — this is your mirror.



^ --> 😄 Every file within the repo stands alone. Clone the repo, open a file, and read.

                                                  ^ i hope you know how to clone a repo -_-
